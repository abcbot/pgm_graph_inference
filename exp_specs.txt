Experiment specifications:

1) In-sample Experiments:
{star, path, fc}_small (train), 1300 graphs -> {star, path, fc}_small (test) 130 graphs, model_name {star, path, fc}_small

2) Out-of-sample Experiments:
TBA

You should be able to run 

```bash
create_data.py --data_mode {train,val,test} [other settings for datasets' names]
```

(several times until all datasets required by dict from exp_helpers are generated), and then

```bash
train.py --train_set_name [...] --mode [...]
```

and

```bash
./experiments/experiments.py [TODO: arguments]
```

(Maybe I will make a bash runner for all of this.)
